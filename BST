Binary Search Tree (BST) is one of the most classic data structures. The definition for its structure is shown as below:

It consists of Nodes and Leaves.
A Node has a child bst on the left side, a key (, a data), and a child bst on the right side. Note here a node's left or right
child is not a node, instead, is indeed another binary search tree.
A Leaf has nothing but act only as a STOP sign.


# type 'a bst_t =  
  | Leaf
  | Node of 'a bst_t * 'a * 'a bst_t     ;;
type 'a bst_t = Leaf | Node of 'a bst_t * 'a * 'a bst_t
# 


The important feature that makes BST unique is for any node 
all keys from its left child are smaller than its own key
all keys from its right child are bigger (assumming keys are distinct)

# let rec insert x = function  
  | Leaf -> Node (Leaf, x, Leaf) (* Leaf is a STOP *)
  | Node (left, k, right) ->
    if x < k then Node (insert x left, k, right) (* if x is smaller, go left *)
    else Node (left, k, insert x right) (* otherwise, go right *)        ;;
val insert : 'a -> 'a bst_t -> 'a bst_t = <fun>
# 

# let rec mem x = function  
  | Leaf -> false
  | Node (left, k, right) -> if x < k then mem x left else if x = k then true else mem x right ;;
val mem : 'a -> 'a bst_t -> bool = <fun>
#
