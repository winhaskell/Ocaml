TaskSum multiples of 3 and 5
You are encouraged to solve this task according to the task description, using any language you may know.

Task
The objective is to write a function that finds the sum of all positive multiples of 3 or 5 below n.

Show output for n = 1000.
Extra credit: do this efficiently for n = 1e20 or higher. 


# let sum_mults n =
        let sum = ref 0 in
            for i = 3 to (n - 1) do
                  if (i mod 3) = 0 || (i mod 5) = 0 then
                        sum := !sum + i;
            done;
          !sum;;
          
val sum_mults : int -> int = <fun>

# print_endline (string_of_int (sum_mults 1000));;
